The Nigerian Lending space is ripe with amazing potentials given its reception and the competitive rates available to meet the diverse monetary needs of a wide array of customers. Using data science, exploratory data analysis and a data set from one of Nigerian's leading banks.

Our objective will be to analyze this data in order to provide answers the following questions which seeks to benefit the bank's lending business.

-	What does the loan data distribution for the bank looks like? Using data science  we will illustrate the most important aspects related to the loans and perform EDA
-	Are the loan grades from the bank optimal? Loan grades measure the likelihood of a client to incur a default, hence crucial for the bank's profitablility
-	Can we create a better optimized model to predict credit risk and beat the currently existing score?

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
